### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Puranjay 
#### I created chip-8 emulator 
The Chip-8 is a virtual machine from the mid-1970s designed to make game development easier. There are a number of classic video games ported to CHIP-8, such as Pong, Space Invaders, Tetris, and Pac-Man. There are also applications like a random maze generator and Conway's Game of Life.

I created new classes in JavaScript for each piece of hardware, to emulate the memory, the display, the sound card, and the keyboard, after that, I jumped into the so expect Chip-8,  I first implemented its registers and then I implement each of its 35 opcodes.

This project uses a lot *Javascript* and OOPS concepts 
It was a fun project to combine my knowledge of Microcontrollers and Web-Development. Plus I never ever implemented my own ROM and emulator . So I learnt a lot from this project  about XOR / OR / AND implementations in a ROM. 

Skills: JAVACRIPT / HTML / Microcontroller Architecture
